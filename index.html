									<h2>Work Experiences</h2>
									<p>
										During my academic journey, I had the privilege of gaining valuable intern experience. <br> <br>
										Technology Innovation and Development Foundation - IIT GUWAHATI
										Smart Pond Monitoring System for Aquaculture Farming and Wetland Monitoring, with Flood Monitoring
										System is my project combines hardware sensors, software applications, and coding languages to provide realtime monitoring, analysis, and management of aquaculture farms, wetland areas, and flood conditions. Coding
										Languages used - JAVA, PYTHON<br> <br>
										
										Java Development - Intern Cloud LLP The 30-day Java Development Internship is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience and practical knowledge in Java programming. Throughout the internship, participants will engage in various learning
										activities and projects to enhance their Java programming skills and gain exposure to real-world development scenarios. Introduction to Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java Libraries and Frameworks,
										Project Development Applying acquired knowledge to develop a Java application or project. <br> <br>

										Data Analytics Virtual Internship - KPMG
										During my Data Analytical Consulting Virtual Internship, I had the opportunity to complete practical
										tasks in three key areas: Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, and Data Insights and Presentation.
										These tasks allowed me to apply data analytic techniques to real-world scenarios and develop valuable
										skills in analyzing and presenting data. Programming used - TABLEAU, MS EXCEL, PYTHON.<br> <br>


										Power BI Virtual Case Experience - PWC
										During my Power BI Virtual Case Experience, I successfully completed three practical tasks: Call Centre
										Trends, Customer Retention, and Diversity and Inclusion. These tasks allowed me to apply Power BI to
										analyze data and gain insights in these specific areas. Programming used - POWER BI, MS EXCEL.</p>

									<h3>Student Performance Prediction</h3>
									<p>The project "Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning" aims to develop a predictive model that can forecast the academic performance of students. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze various factors and attributes associated with students' educational data and predict their future performance.
									By gathering historical data such as previous grades, attendance records, study habits, socioeconomic factors, and demographic information, the predictive model can identify patterns and correlations that contribute to student success. The model learns from this data and develops the ability to predict the academic performance of individual students or groups of students.</p>

									<h3>Unemployement Analysis with Python</h3>
									<p>Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
										who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. I realise a sharp
										increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
										can be a good data science project</p>

									<h3>Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning</h3>
									<p>The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
										features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
										prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.</p>

									<h3>Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning</h3>
									<p>Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
										that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
										messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
										In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
										train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and not spam.</p>

									<h3>Sales Prediction using Python</h3>
									<p>Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
										such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
										advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
										Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
										their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
										product. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python</p>
